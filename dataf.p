aVWell stocks play a focus for investors focus for anybody watching you're saying that the economic back to all this stuff to Jim for a great a lot started since the and the standing it this year economic data surprises into being otherwise how but issue you about the underlying economic picture fear that we  very very constructed as far as Europe's consent for the first time in quite a while I mean you're I think pointed out economic growth has been there for a while and you know that maybe even surprises half picked up but  There's a few things that we profoundly changed over the last six foot three to six months and which is that the number of tailwinds which are going to support the European economy in two thousand and fifteen is the Euro which is we can thematically it's the energy prices which I've got quite substantially and of course it's  it's the yield levels but take the other seven European countries effect is the real you've levels of those if you look at France's renewed levels off Italy that basically zero across the coverage the first time really since the crisis started the seven European countries now have a very accommodative monetary and financial backed up and I think it's very important to for a while we were talking about party in your it all the way but we got down to about one point one point zero five the house top of it is not off the cost that was the psychological step to fall fully in the markets look I mean when you when you apply few sort of  micro measures the euro is probably two-week already that doesn't mean that we don't see you know stain week for a while  but that is it seems very difficult three to say why we should be pushing substantially lower from him on that's  sort of the week calamity not the standing of course  So wrong about these that's probably a little bit lower is is what we see things are heading out and so you know in substantial below Patty I don't really see a reason for that and they are very very constructive on you're in the low wages that will will investing in still in the European equity markets to see the ball market well yes the the today wedding express that  That said delicious if you like about what's going on in the years I look if you are afraid of the start of the bond market thing we have very clearly differentiate between on the one hand so that the the call markets the risk free markets where frankly I economy to become to bullish at the Tenure bold when that brought about twenty basis points is just seems very difficult  We are however very constructive still everything has but attached to it so the the prefer Bond Markets weather for the most part compression to come beaten some of the corporate markets well you know we not only see innovations that we'll see of them on for a sort of  you know pickup so that's probably going to perform so that differentiation and one knock it needs to be made and then if we look at the equity market I mean it with the US economy being strong with all the tailwinds I mentioned and the equity market for me also though that they would just fine and we've seen substantial really already in the first quarter of this year on about twenty percent and most of the in the sees  in in Western Europe at least Greece again is is a is an exception yeah and that seems to be continuing can you say a situation where it was real lesson zero percent so when could that happened what could be a trader, to make that happen well I mean what we've seen as and again one of those crucial differences I mentioned earlier over the last couple of months in the last year old the second part of of last year when things that both one years down where the substantial drop inflation expectations and says the ECB rolled out that touches program that change supported use of nominal terms of transforming but inflation expectations after rising now you ask me what could take up and years going even further down one thing that I can definitely see is that that picture changes again inflation expectations to stop propping is a very bad scenario it in that case second FTC it okay they said thank you very much for joining us getting see this morning it's a fake head of European rates and ultimately he says I will be see capital markets pilot by the.

aVWhich and the concert held you noticed he said he said in this I I thought this fascinating he said that we are in a range the Fed's target now is a range of German twenty-five and then he said we're going to move to a range of twenty five to fifty yeah so the Fed isn't it may not be raising rates by a specified about just moving ranges so we absolutely the range remove the twenty five basis points a time in a reason to that is this is an excess reserves that they can't really control the funds rate within point actress either way that in the past I'm been that's why right now the Rangers ear to twenty five in the effect of is running in the middle that so they will announce the first movie presumably be twenty five basis points increase specifically an interesting reserves from two to five to point five in the new range for the fun St Louis forty-five to point five but they can't exactly control the country that's whether announcing ranges  The other debate over the weekend is  It's a if they didn't want to be more aggressive where they did when it control rates more they could sell securities that event they're not going to do that easy to be forced to me no I mean I don't really doubt that that ability to take financial conditions they really want to be the comes to in the gonna go more aggressively in the country that the reason signaling now Soviet now to see the end of the day of the thing to taking the funds read up to five percent and bundles are still two percent which I would say is highly highly highly unlikely that they could start selling long treasuries well that I think they're alone long way from that I think there's plenty of room to raise the country taking financial conditions first.

aVI wanted the light of will she two thousand and fifteen already doing so to a great extent you can argue the first borders been built on the street I mean if you read through the for that would be baseball be the weather I guess but  the rise in US dollar  And the week Euro can confidently central banks  which are related and oil price declines those are  It's ever seems three  items shaping your investments through the year two thousand fifteen the chief investment officer at high tower treasury partners and he is with us  here in the studio of those three me as I said to can all underway but what's going to prove to be the most important, pull all three or interrelated and most dominant thing right now is the lower oil prices which is creating winners and losers amongst companies and countries so there are countries out there that have  really based themselves on oil exports and at the same time they built a lot of us for years debt, and in a having service it would lower receipts and lower oil prices as well as a weaker currency so in the global arena lower oil prices are having harmful impact on certain exporting nations, in terms of the domestic arena it is our consumers a tremendous dividend but it will really be born and in the you  as to the second till the second half of this year so the oil dividend will benefit the US and consumer discretionary stocks yet globally it presents letter risks out on the horizon, what  what I mean it will be really feel here in the US until the second half of the year due to the fact that consumers are right now sucking away their benefits instead of spending and some things going to change your mind absolutely it's called the permanent income apotheosis where they initially save it and it becomes reeling consistent and permanent them to go and start spending it that's not a permanent right I mean who prices most people think they're going to go back up a they'll go one forty a barrel or something but  which I think right I mean you know it's going to be there it's transit Tory interview and so we think there's going to be an opportunity to  invest in oil stocks at some point in this cycle because oil will go back , what's interesting when you look at the US economy USGDP in today's earnings picture of the  early multinational oil companies are having reduced earnings obviously and its impacting S and P estimates right but the head of the oil earnings story and then there's everybody else exactly that's benefiting right but what's interesting is that if you look at oil industry employment relative to the housing and she's employment housing employee seven times the amount of workers then the oil industry.
